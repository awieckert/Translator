# TRAGDOR TRANSLATOR!!!!

## Description
This crazy translator was an excersise to practice adding event listeners to elements of the DOM. This project was also used to strengthen our existing understanding of objects, array's and loops.

I challenged myself to dynamically target JS object's based on the ID of the button clicked.
